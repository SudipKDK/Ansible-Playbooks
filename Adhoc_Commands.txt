Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands 

Ad-Hoc commands are quick, one-line commands to perform tasks on remote servers
without writing a playbook.

Syntax:

ansible <host-pattern> -m <module> -a "<module-arguments>" [options]
<host-pattern> : host/group from inventory (e.g., all)
-m <module>    : module to use (ping, apt, service, copy, shell, etc.)
-a "<args>"    : arguments for the module
-b             : run with sudo/root privileges

2. Common Examples:

1. Ping all hosts
ansible all -m ping

2. all a package (Ubuntu/Debian)
ansible all -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" -b

3. Start a service
ansible all -m service -a "name=nginx state=started enabled=yes" -b

4. Run shell commands
ansible all -m shell -a "uptime"
ansible all -m shell -a "df -h"

5. Download a file from internet
ansible all -m get_url -a "url=https://example.com/file.txt dest=/tmp/file.txt" -b

6. Reboot remote hosts
ansible all -m reboot -b
